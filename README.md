srcerr
======

A simple game in which hacking is magic.

Justification
=============
Do you want to do real magic?? 

Are you a programmer who secretly wishes to be a wizard? 

Do you want to learn programming and magic at the same time?

*Well, srcerr is the game for you and everyone you know and everyone else!*

The Game
========
You, the player, control a sorceror (or srcerr), who is faced with defeating an evil monster one a simple, square field.
All you can do is move around the screen, desperately avoiding the attacks of the monster...Until you code your first spell.

You can code spells in Python using a simple library of methods to create spells. A spell can do almost anything; it is only bounded by your imagination and coding skills.
Within the game, you can cast spells to your heart's content. However, each method called by any spell reduces your "Energy" in proportion to the "power" of the spell.
Casting too many spells, or coding ultra-powerful spells, will cause you to drain your energy and eventually die.

In summary, this game is a test of ingenuity, programming skills, and resourcefulness. In the future, this could even be used to teach Python!

Example Spells
--------------
Simple Attack: This spell will move to your bottom-right, dealing damage if the monster is nearby until 1000 ticks have gone by.

Heal: This spell stays still. If the player is on top of the spell, the player will gain health. 
If the player stays away for 50 ticks, then the spell stops.

*It is important to stop spells or limit their power so your energy doesn't run out!*
